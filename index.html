Hello! I recently completed my master's thesis in machine learning and signal processing in the
<a href="https://www.pdx.edu/engineering/" target="_blank">Electrical and Computer Engineering Department</a>
at Portland State University, advised by 
<a href="https://www.teuscher-lab.com" target="_blank">Dr. Christof Teuscher</a>.
My work focused on deep reinforcement learning, information-theoretic control, and recursive Bayesian estimation.
Specifically, my research explored the application of these methods to gamma radiation source search.
Please see <a href="publications/" target="_blank">here</a> for a list of my publications.

I received my undergraduate degree at the University of California Santa Barbara in biopsychology with an emphasis in the human vision system.
In my spare time, I enjoy running outdoors, <a href="https://lexfridman.com/podcast/" target="_blank">philosophical discussion</a>, and continued learning.
