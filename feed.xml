        <title>A Brief Overview of On-policy Reinforcement Learning Theory</title>
        <description>
          
          This is the second in a series of posts detailing the application of deep reinforcement learning to radiation source search. In this post, we will cover the theory and basics of reinforcement learning, on-policy deep reinforcement learning, the advantage actor critic, and proximal policy optimization. This post will be heavy...

        <title>Radiation Source Search Gym Environment</title>
        <description>
          
          This is the first in a series of posts detailing the application of deep reinforcement learning to radiation source search. In this post, we will cover the basics of the nuclear source search task and how we modeled our reinforcement learning environment. Code for the radiation search environment is found...
